Talks lined up:

**Static code analysis for Kotlin: A Guiding Star** - _Vladislav Ermolin, Senior Android Developer at Flo Health_        
Community has created multiple static code analysis tools for Kotlin. We'll discuss what makes them unique, and, what's more important, what unites them all. With the use of this knowledge, creating custom rule for any of those tools becomes an abstract task, which we'll observe on example.

**Think Once, Think Twice, Think Multiplatform**  - _Robertas Å etkus, Senior Android/Flutter Developer at BT Group_     
Brief introduction into emerging Kotlin technology to build applications once for Android and iOS, including tips of how power up development environment, to setup a project, and where to progress to a more elaborate project.
