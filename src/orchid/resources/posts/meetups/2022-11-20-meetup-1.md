*Agenda:*
- Static code analysis for Kotlin: A Guiding Star - Vladislav Ermolin  
Community has created multiple static code analysis tools for Kotlin. We'll discuss what makes them unique, and, what's more important, what unites them all. With the use of this knowledge, creating custom rule for any of those tools becomes an abstract task, which we'll observe on example.
